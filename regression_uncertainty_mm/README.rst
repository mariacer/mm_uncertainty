Running experiments
===================

Experiments using Gaussian or flow-based likelihood models need to be run from their respective folders ``gaussian_likelihoods`` and ``normalizing_flows``.
Detailed descriptions of command-line options to be used for each setting to reproduce experimental results of the paper can be found within the ``README`` files of each folder.
