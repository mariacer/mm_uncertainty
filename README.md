# Uncertainty estimation under model misspecification in neural network regression

Analysis of the implications of model misspecification for estimating uncertainty when doing regression when neural networks.

## Requirements

You need to install the [hypnettorch library](https://github.com/chrhenning/hypnettorch) by doing `python3 -m pip install hypnettorch`.

## Documentation

How to build the documentation is explained in the `docs` folder.

## Running experiments

For running experiments, move to the `mm_uncertainty` subfolder. Further instructions can be found on the [README](mm_uncertainty/README.rst) there.

## Citation

When using this package in your research project, please consider citing our workshop paper for which this repository has been developed.
